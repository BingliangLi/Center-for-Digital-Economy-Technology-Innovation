# Structure of the center. 
The center will have a director and an associate director, who are responsible for the management of the center. Under the center, there are several (currently five) interest groups. Each interest group focuses on one common research area that is interested by the group member, and each group has one coordinator and at least one other faculty. Each group needs to have regular planed events (group meetings, seminars, etc.), and the schedule for these events will be posted on the website such that other faculty and students in SDS may also attend events without joining the interest group. Interest group members can terminate an interest group if all member agree, and faculty members in SDS can also create new interest groups, as long as they follow the rules of the center.

# The objectives of this center include:
