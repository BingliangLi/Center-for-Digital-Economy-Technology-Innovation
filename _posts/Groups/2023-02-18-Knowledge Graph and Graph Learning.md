# Research Interests
This interest group focuses specifically on knowledge graphs and graph learning, aiming to explore these two fields and their intersection. A knowledge graph is a method of graphically representing knowledge that can help people understand complex information and relationships. Graph learning is a method of learning from graph data that can help us better understand data and relationships. In this group, we will discuss the latest research on knowledge graphs and graph learning, share practical experience, and exchange ideas with others interested in these two fields. Members are encouraged to ask questions, engage in discussions, and learn more about these technologies through collaborative projects.
