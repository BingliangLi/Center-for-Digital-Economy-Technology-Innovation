# Research Interests
This interest group specializes in research and development of cyber-physical systems, with a focus on exploring collaborative intelligence between people, machines, and systems. Our goal is to advance the field of robotics, edge computing, and distributed optimization and explore their intersections. This group is interested in various applications, such as marine robots, the internet of things, and multi-agent systems, among others.
